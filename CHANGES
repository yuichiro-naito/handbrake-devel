Changes since 1.2.2:
  - fix portlint warning
      - USES line more earlier
  - change to use libvpx from port
      It is upstream's decision.
  - update contrib libraries
      fdk-aac 2.0.1
      ffmpeg 4.2.1
      libbluray 1.1.2
      libdvdnav 6.0.1
      libdvdread 6.0.2
      dav1d 0.5.0
      x265 3.2
  - python3 support for building.
  - add build dependency of devel/meson.
  - pkg-decr mentions about VP8, VP9 video codecs.

Notes for reviewers:
  - USES+=meson adds extra configure options that HandBrake's configure 
    never understand. Meson dependency should be in BUILD_DEPENDS.
  - Portlint warns about consider using NLS knob. But HandBrake always requires
    gettext with X11. It's not selectable, so NLS should not be in OPTIONS_DEFINE.
